Jagged Path
===========

An in-browser 2D exploration RPG in early development. Inspired by *A Dark Room's "Dusty Path"*, *RuneScape* and *Star Sonata* but originally started as a demo for a section of another game. Jagged Path is a client based browser game written in JavaScript.

Currently there isn't much to do in the game, but it's in a playable state and can be played [here](http://jagged-path.jbobbo.net/).
